Project: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) Using Deep Learning
Developed a Sign Language Recognition (SLR) system to recognize static and dynamic hand gestures using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques.
Implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network to effectively classify hand gestures and convert them into corresponding English text.
Focused on improving communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, by providing an efficient and user-friendly solution.
Leveraged neural network architectures for real-time gesture recognition, increasing the accessibility and ease of communication for non-verbal users
